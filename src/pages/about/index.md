<p>Launched 2015 and headquartered in Chancery Lane, London, Lavanda started out as a property management company, responsible for over 500 properties throughout the UK. After experiencing frustration from a lack of key features across different PMS providers, Lavanda made the bold move to create their own PMS to handle their operations. After seeing the success being driven by Lavanda's PMS, other property management companies were rapidly signing up to be moved onto the platform.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, Lavanda has transformed into an exciting technology start-up with clients around the world, 40+ employees and more than $10m raised from investors.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>What we do:</h3>
<p>Lavanda is a B2B software company. We&rsquo;ve developed an award-winning, best-in-class SaaS platform, enabling property management, build to rent and PBSA operators to manage their portfolios with a complete short-term rental solution.</p>
