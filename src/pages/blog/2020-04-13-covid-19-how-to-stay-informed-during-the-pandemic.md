  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is currently an abundance of
  information around the impact of COVID-19 on the short-term rental industry,
  and it is easy to feel overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite initial predictions of 2020 being a successful year for the industry, we are dealing with an unprecedented collapse of short-term rentals, due to travel restrictions and lockdowns all around the world.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a short-term rental property manager, it is critical that you stay well informed about industry changes and predictions, in order to best optimize your business during this difficult time.</span></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>What Do I Need to Stay Informed About?</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Channel Changes: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">What changes are happening to the channels I am operating on. Will I be impacted by cancellation and refund policies, or the ability to list my property?</span></li>

  <li><strong>Survival Options:</strong> What options do I have during this period to increase my chances of survival. For instance, reducing costs, optimising my operations and/or pivoting to diversify my revenue streams temporarily?</li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Support Available: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">What support is available for my business, and can I apply for any financial relief from my government?</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Market Projections: </strong>What data is there to indicate the recovery of the market; what can I expect when this happens; and how can I prepare for this?</li>

  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>What Sources Should I Look At?</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Channels:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For any news to do with the channel (Airbnb, Booking.com, HomeAway, and so on), we recommend you acquire that information directly from them. This is to ensure you get the most accurate and up to date information about any changes and how this will affect your business. For instance, Airbnb released an official statement last week about what they are doing to support their hosts, and they have a help centre where you can enquire and seek support directly from there.&nbsp;</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Industry Data and Projections: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sources like </span><a href="https://www.airdna.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AirDNA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer reliable and objective data that is directly relevant to short-term rental managers. Although you have to pay for some of their data, they have released free reports focused on COVID-19. Their most recent one is available </span><a href="https://www.airdna.co/blog/coronavirus-update-2-impact-on-strs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Industry Forums: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend you join reliable forums with fellow property manager professionals - It&rsquo;s important to stay connected at this time. We recommend </span><a href="https://www.professionalhostalliance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Professional Host Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who have a highly-vetted community of short-term rental property managers. They hold webinars; allow members to post and discuss key topics; and post a weekly digest of relevant industry news and its impact on short-term rental property managers.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Search Engines:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may wish to set up Google Alerts for keywords like &lsquo;Airbnb&rsquo; or &lsquo;Short-Term Rentals&rsquo;. This will essentially send you a regular email of the new reports to do with the key-words you&rsquo;ve set up. Be sure to filter through the results that are sent to you, to find those from the most reliable sources.</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, only read the information that is relevant to</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">business. It&rsquo;s easy to get snowed under with the wealth of information available right now. We are all in survival mode. Each business will handle this differently, and you have to strategically make decisions which are best and most viable for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> business and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">your </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">future in the industry.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will be releasing more information about your options for survival during this pandemic - from financial optimisation, to infrastructural optimisation.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As experienced property managers, we know how tough it can be to run a highly-operational business, and how easily revenues can be impacted by external market changes, like this one. That is why we are here to help you during this time, even if it&rsquo;s just for a chat. So please don&rsquo;t hesitate to </span><a href="mailto:hello@getlavanda.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reach out to us,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we're in this together.</span></p>
