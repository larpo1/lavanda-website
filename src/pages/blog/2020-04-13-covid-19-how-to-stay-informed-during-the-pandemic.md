  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is currently an abundance of
  information around the impact of COVID-19 on the short-term rental industry,
  and it is easy to feel overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite initial predictions of 2020 being a boom year, the industry finds itself struggling to cope in the face of a "black swan" event, prompted by global lockdowns and travel restrictions.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a short-term rental property manager, it's now more critical than ever that you stay well informed about industry trends in order to best optimize your business during this difficult time.</span></p>

  <p><strong>What Do I Need to Stay Informed About?</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>OTA Changes: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">What changes are happening to the channels I am operating on? Will I be impacted by cancellation and refund policies, or the ability to list my property?</span></li>

  <li><strong>Survival Options:</strong> Right now, what options do I have to increase my chances of survival? For instance reducing costs, optimising my operations and/or pivoting to diversify my revenue streams temporarily.</li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Support Available: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">What support is available for my business? Can I apply for any financial aid or relief packages from local government?</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Market Projections: </strong>What data is there to indicate when the market might recover, and what that recovery might look lke? What can I expect when this happens? How can I prepare for this?</li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>What Sources Should I Look To?</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>OTAs:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For any news regarding specific OTAs (Airbnb, Booking.com, HomeAway, etc.), we recommend you acquire all information directly from them. This is to ensure you get the most accurate and up to date information about any changes and how this will affect your business. For instance, Airbnb have a <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/2701/extenuating-circumstances-policy-and-the-coronavirus-covid19">help centre</a> where hosts can enquire and seek support directly.&nbsp;</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Industry Data and Projections: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sources like </span><a href="https://www.airdna.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AirDNA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer reliable and objective data that is directly relevant to short-term rental managers. Although you may have to pay for some of their data/reports, they've released a number free reports focused on COVID-19. Their most recent one is available </span><a href="https://www.airdna.co/blog/coronavirus-update-2-impact-on-strs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Industry Forums: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key source of news and best practice is in specific forums and communities. We recommend </span><a href="https://www.professionalhostalliance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Professional Host Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who have a highly-vetted community of short-term rental property managers comitted to informing and shaping the future of the industry. They hold webinars sharing relevant information and thought leadership, allow members to seek specific operational advice and post topics for discusson. They also post a weekly digest of industry news and its specific impact on short-term rental property managers.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Search Engines:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may wish to set up Google Alerts for keywords like &lsquo;Airbnb&rsquo; or &lsquo;Short-Term Rentals&rsquo;. This will essentially send you a regular email of the new reports to do with the key-words you&rsquo;ve set up. Be sure to filter through the results that are sent to you, to find those from the most reliable sources.</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s easy to get snowed under with the wealth of information available right now, so most important of al is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only to act upon information as it is relevant to<em> your </em>business. The world is in survival mode, and businesses will all choose to cope with this differently. Be sure to make the decisions that are right fit for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> business and the aspirations that <em>you</em> have with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this industry.</span></p>
