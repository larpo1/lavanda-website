  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short-term rental industry is more
  competitive than ever with companies like Airbnb, Booking.com and
  Homeaway/VRBO leading the marketplace for property managers to showcase their
  rentals to a global audience. It's therefore essential for property listings
  to stand out and capture the attention of guests to attract
  bookings.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an experienced property manager ourselves, Lavanda has pulled together our tips on how to best optimise your Airbnb listings in order to stay one step ahead of your competition, attracting more guests and higher revenues.</span></p>

  <h3><strong>Pricing&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that price is a key factor when deciding on a place to stay. You can manage your pricing manually, or seek to optimise it with specialist dynamic pricing tools. Whichever you choose, it's essential that your prices are accurate according to the location, season, property condition and amenities offered.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dynamic pricing tool is a great way to reliably and competitively price your properties based on real-time industry data - such as events going on in your area, or the prices of comparable nearby rentals.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you are manually pricing your properties, amending your prices as frequently as every day is a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">must.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To accurately price them, you will need to regularly research events going on nearby in order to estimate the demand, and adjust prices accordingly. Higher rental prices can often be set during peak times, such as New Year, or when a popular event is happening in the area. The right price point is best gauged by tracking your local competition.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you manage your pricing manually or through a tool, it is recommended that you regularly modify the price in order to optimise your exposure on Airbnb.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <h3><strong>Photos</strong></h3>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional photography will enhance the visual impact of your listing, whilst ensuring that prospective guests can clearly see the property and its amenities. When taking the photographs, dress the rental up to give it a welcoming and homely feel. This can be as simple as a decorative throw and pillows on the bed, from an open book or pot of tea on the kitchen table.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In regard to the order of your photos on the listing itself, research indicates that the optimal order of photos to stimulate clicks and engagement is: Living Room, Bedroom, Bathroom, Kitchen, Shared Spaces.</span></p>

  <h3><strong>Title&nbsp;</strong></h3>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure your title is relevant, catchy and includes key search terms. You might choose to include the location of the property, or individual characteristics - like &lsquo;Beautiful Victorian Home With View Over</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hyde Park&rsquo;. Again, you may wish to adjust this regularly to test the impact of the terms you are using upon enquiries/bookings.</span></p>

  <h3><strong>Listing Content</strong></h3>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">List all amenities, no matter how small. Wi-Fi is a must. Others might include extra blankets, hairdryers and toiletries.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to periodically update your listing. In the case of Airbnb, the activity of editing your listing is tracked and can boost your search ranking, attracting more eyeballs and stimulating bookings. Try amending the listing daily - for instance updating the price, changing the order of the images, or even adding a little bit to the description.</span></p>

  <h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always ask happy guests to leave you a review. Airbnb&rsquo;s ranking algorithm places hosts with great reviews higher up in the search results. The happier your guests, the higher you will rank.</span></p>

  <h3><strong>Bookings</strong></h3>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb also ranks you higher if you&rsquo; maintain a record of quick responses to guests enquiries. It&rsquo;s also key to note that prospective guests are seeking as much convenience as possible when finding a rental. By turning on &lsquo;Instant Booking&rsquo; you are able to offer guests instant gratification and peace of mind that their accommodation need has been solved - avoiding having to wait for the host to accept their booking.</span></p>
