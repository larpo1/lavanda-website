  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure is what determines your
  efficiency as a business - both in terms of </span><span style="font-weight:
  400;">minimising your cost-to-serve and maximising your productivity. This is
  typically driven by the efficiency of your core business processes, and your
  capacity to communicate and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">share
  information effectively. Most of this is enabled by technology in some way or
  other, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">so critically reevaluating your
  technology toolkit and infrastructure is key to optimising
  performance.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><strong>Automate wherever possible</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don&rsquo;t yet have a property management system (PMS), it may be time to consider using one - depending on how many properties you manage. If you do have a PMS, make sure that you are able to automate key workflows, thus minimising your cost to serve and making your business more profitable, whilst reducing the chances of human error.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation is a key way to reduce the level of human effort required during this time, especially if you are furloughing part of your team.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Cleanliness and sanitation</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new operational challenge during this time is quality control. We have another blog post on cleaning tips during COVID-19, to ensure that your cleaning procedures are reducing any risk of infection after a guest changeover. If you are using Lavanda&rsquo;s PMS, you can create an extensive checklist for your housekeepers to complete to properly clean and disinfect the property. They can access this on their phone to tick off areas of the property to disinfect. For instance, they can see and tick off disinfecting: door handles, remote controls, light switches, tap handles, keys, and so on.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to check your local guidelines on cleanliness of accommodation, and be sure to adapt your operational processes and workflows accordingly.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Direct bookings</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A direct booking website is not only a brilliant piece of external branding, but it can also help you to drive more profitable bookings, by avoiding channel fees. Direct booking sites are generally low cost (often free depending on your PMS provider) and should require minimal maintenance, post setup.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By implementing this infrastructure now, you open your property management business up to greater control of the experience that you offer your guests, including how you remarket to them, incentivise them to book again and refer their friends and family.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Mid and long-term rentals</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the lack of short-term rental demand, many property managers are opting to rent properties on a mid or long-term basis instead. Regardless of the current market, demand for longer-term stays/tenancies remains robust. A 6-month tenancy may likely see you through until mainstream short-term rental demand returns.</span></p>
