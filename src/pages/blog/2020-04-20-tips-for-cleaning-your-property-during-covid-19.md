  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are one of the many hosts who
  continue to let their properties during the pandemic, for longer-let reasons
  or for key workers, it is essential that you are cleaning properly between
  guests, to prevent the spread of the disease.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Why Cleaning is a Top Priority</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is critical to reduce the risk of spreading infection during the COVID-19 outbreak. Particularly within shared use properties.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 can be easily spread by touching a contaminated surface, including door handles, remote controls, bathroom taps, and so on. Contamination of a surface can last for days, which is why it is crucial that your property is thoroughly cleaned during the switch over of guests.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Cleaning for COVID-19</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Disinfecting: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need to ensure that your cleaning staff are not only cleaning surfaces, but also disinfecting them. Simply cleaning surfaces with regular soap or cleaning products may make the surfaces look visibly cleaner, but chemical disinfectants will actually kill the germs, and therefore lower the risk of infection. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, ensure that your cleaners and both cleaning</span><strong><em> </em></strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disinfecting your properties between guest stays. You can track whether cleaners are doing this for every property, through the use of a PMS. Lavanda&rsquo;s PMS has a feature for cleaning staff where all tasks need to be ticked off, in order to mark the property clean as complete. In this instance, you can ensure that your cleaners have a checklist on their phone of areas to disinfect in the property, to make sure they don&rsquo;t miss anything. For instance, they can see and tick off disinfecting: door handles, remote controls, light switches, tap handles, keys, and so on.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Personal Protection:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your cleaners should wear disposable gloves and masks to avoid any risk of infection. These should be disposed of after each clean. Cleaners should wash hands thoroughly after each clean and avoid touching their face.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ventilation:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Request your cleaners open the windows at the beginning of the clean, allowing fresh air to circulate the property during the time they are there.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Soft Furnishings: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, machine wash the soft furnishings with soft porous surfaces, like decorative pillows.&nbsp;</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Linen and Towels:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wash at the highest heat setting recommended by the manufacturer. Including bedsheets, pillow cases, towels and blankets.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Hoover: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empty the hoover after each clean, to rid the property of any germs from the previous stay.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cleaning Supplies:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your cleaners re-use any supplies including cloths, they should be disinfected and thoroughly washed at high temperatures before using again at the next property.</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Protecting Your Guests&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure the property is well stocked with the amenities that your guests will need during their stay. You may wish to consider a few extra items such as antibacterial hand wash, sanitizer and disposable wipes.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inform your guests that you have taken extra precautions by taking additional steps to clean and disinfect the property to a high standard. This will reassure the guest that the property is safe.</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay Safe!&nbsp;</span></p>
