  <h1 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Airbnb lowers internal valuation by 16% to
  $26bn.</h1>

  <p dir="ltr">Airbnb has been hit by a sharp drop in bookings because of the coronavirus outbreak. It isn't clear what the reason or source of this valuation is, but a 16% reduction seems a pretty good result in this market.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/booking.com/"> Booking.com</a> down 40% and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/expedia/"> Expedia Group</a> down 60%, with the S&amp;P down 25%.</p>

  <p dir="ltr">Discussion Point</p>

  <p dir="ltr">Is this an indication that short-term rentals could bounce back strongly in 2021?</p>

  <ul>

  <li dir="ltr">

  <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&ldquo;Alternative accommodation&rdquo; is perceived to be safer for avoiding the virus than a hotel.</p>

  </li>

  <li dir="ltr">

  <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Domestic travel is likely to spike faster as long-distance travel remains in doubt and&nbsp; more precarious.</p>

  </li>

  <li dir="ltr">

  <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Economic conditions make a cheaper holiday rental more compelling than other forms of accommodation.</p>

  </li>

  </ul>
