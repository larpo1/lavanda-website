At Lavanda our mission is to develop, enable and accelerate a trusted, professional and sustainable short-term rental sector. 

We’re now taking that mission to the next level.

Today Lavanda is launching the **Professional Host Alliance**, a global initiative that recognises short-term rental operators and property managers as key stakeholders in alternative accommodation ecosystem - and critically an audience that is both platform-agnostic and independent of the major OTAs. 

## What is the Professional Host Alliance?

The Professional Host Alliance is a global community of short-term rental operators and property managers in pursuit of a common mission:

* To continuously improve the experience for guests and hosts within the alternative accommodation sector.
* To support this, we believe there is a need to professionalise the alternative accommodation sector.
* To build a sustainable and futureproof short-term rental ecosystem with real social and economic impact.

If you share these beliefs, and want to play an active role in shaping the future of this industry - both in your immediate local market, and at a global level - we welcome you to come and join us.

## How do members benefit?

Membership is free, and members have access to the following benefits:

* Access to business growth opportunities
* Access to educational and networking events
* Access to industry trends and insights.
* Opportunities to participate in PR, events and awards that recognise industry best practice and innovation in short-term rental management
* Display the Professional Host Alliance logo on your website and marketing collateral

## What agenda will Professional Host Alliance pursue?

The Professional Host Alliance is not a talking shop. We are committed to accelerating real industry-wide innovation and change, and most importantly putting professional hosts at the heart of that of that change: 

* We will develop and promote a shared vision for a sustainable global industry.
* We will work with OTAs and technology providers to realise that vision and create the missing tools needed to overcome key challenges around professional hosting.
* We will collaborate to unlock new channels that boost occupancy and improve the core economics of professional hosts.
* We will educate travel, real estate, and hospitality industry stakeholders as to how they can effectively embrace opportunities offered by short-term rentals and the alternative accommodation sector.

## How do I join the Professional Host Alliance?
