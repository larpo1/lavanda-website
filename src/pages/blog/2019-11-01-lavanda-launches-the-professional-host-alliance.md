  <p>Lavanda has launched the <strong><a
  href="https://www.professionalhostalliance.com/">Professional Host
  Alliance</a></strong>, a global initiative that recognises short-term rental
  operators and property managers as key stakeholders in the alternative
  accommodation ecosystem - and critically an audience that is both
  platform-agnostic and independent of the major OTAs.</p>

  <h2>What is the Professional Host Alliance?</h2>

  <p>The Professional Host Alliance is a global community of like-minded
  short-term rental operators and property managers in pursuit of a common
  mission:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>To continuously improve the experience for guests and hosts within the
  alternative accommodation sector.</li>

  <li>To support this, we believe there is a need to professionalise and
  standardise the alternative accommodation sector.</li>

  <li>To build a sustainable and futureproof short-term rental ecosystem with
  real social and economic impact.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>If you share these beliefs, and want to play an active role in shaping the
  future of this industry - both in your immediate local market, and at a global
  level - we welcome you to come and join us.</p>

  <h2>Why now?</h2>

  <p>There are a number of trends happening which have led to the launch of the
  Professional Host Alliance. Firstly, the highly-fragmented global community of
  short-term rental managers is now growing fast. Secondly, in parallel with the
  fragmented growth of this key stakeholder group, we see multiple disparate
  initiatives by OTAs and technology providers seeking to engage with them. We
  believe a continuation of the current context can only lead to a number of
  sub-optimal outcomes for property managers, and moreover for the industry as a
  whole. Here's why:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>The pursuit of different, unconnected initiatives by the primary
  influencers of the short-term rental ecosystem <em>in reality only ends up
  further complicating the business of their target audience</em> (i.e. the
  property managers themselves). This has the unwanted knock-on effect of making
  better experiences for guests and hosts even harder to deliver - rather than
  having the desired effect of accelerating the professionalisation of the
  industry.</li>

  <li>Many initiatives being pursued in the market fail to show a deep enough
  understanding of the nuanced wants and needs of property managers themselves.
  We put this down to simple communication failure, or more specifically the
  lack of an efficient interface to enable more effective collaboration between
  property managers and external stakeholder groups. The PHA will become this
  interface, and is tasked with understanding and representing the priorities,
  needs and challenges of our membership.</li>

  <li>All of the above is largely the result of property managers being a
  historically reactive community who have waited for OTAs and technology
  providers to announce their initiatives, rather than seeking to inform them
  more actively and/or lobby them for better support. This is because there has
  been no formal structure to support more effective collaboration, and enable
  the property management community to better flex its collective muscle within
  the ecosystem. Again, a problem that the PHA can solve by putting an effective
  structure in place.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>How do members benefit?</h2>

  <p>Membership of the Professional Host Alliance is free, and members have
  access to the following benefits:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Access to business growth opportunities</li>

  <li>Access to educational and networking events</li>

  <li>Access to industry trends and insights.</li>

  <li>Opportunities to participate in PR, events and awards that recognise
  industry best practice and innovation in short-term rental management</li>

  <li>Display the Professional Host Alliance logo on your website and marketing
  collateral</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>What agenda will the Professional Host Alliance pursue?</h2>

  <p>The Professional Host Alliance is not a talking shop. We are committed to
  accelerating real industry-wide innovation and change, and most importantly
  putting professional hosts at the heart of that change:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>We will develop and promote a shared vision for a sustainable global
  industry.</li>

  <li>We will work with OTAs and technology providers to realise that vision and
  create the missing tools needed to overcome key challenges around professional
  hosting.</li>

  <li>We will collaborate to unlock new channels that boost occupancy and
  improve the core economics of professional hosts.</li>

  <li>We will educate travel, real estate, and hospitality industry stakeholders
  as to how they can effectively embrace opportunities offered by short-term
  rentals and the alternative accommodation sector.</li>

  </ul>
