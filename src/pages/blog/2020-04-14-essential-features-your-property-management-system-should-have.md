  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in good property management
  system (PMS) can save you a lot of time and money. It is important to be
  selective when choosing a PMS to ensure your operations are as lean as they
  possibly can be. The cheapest option might not always be the best for your
  business!</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selecting a tech partner is a huge commitment and time should be spent when deciding which partner is truly best for your business over the long term - it is by no means something that should be rushed into. Lean operations are a key driver for growth as a property manager - and maximising your margins should be a top priority. </span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;ve compiled a list of some of the essential features a PMS should feature.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than a clunky user interface. It takes longer to train your staff and causes all around aggravation. It is highly beneficial to have user-friendly software that keeps your whole team engaged. Happy staff, happy guests!</span></p>

  <p><strong>Task Allocations</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing tasks can be hard work. Ensuring cleaners are at the right property at the right time and maintenance tasks are followed up as soon as possible - is essential to minimise disruption.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><strong>Sales Toolkit</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s no secret that it&rsquo;s not easy finding new properties to manage. Being proactive is key to the growth of your property management business. It&rsquo;s imperative to ensure you have a sales toolkit to have leads flowing in continuously at the top of the sales funnel.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a CRM tool and easy to use website - along with a valuation tool for property owners can be invaluable for finding and then following up leads. Use a PMS that actively helps with growth, or sign up to an additional CRM package to keep track of your leads.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><strong>Multi-calendar</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate view for every revenue manager! And quite rightly, one of the most important tools for your property management business. See exactly when properties are booked or available all on one screen. Adjust prices to fill voids and ensure occupancy is maximised.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><strong>Dynamic Pricing&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A property manager is as good as their pricing! Maximise your revenues with a dynamic pricing tool. It&rsquo;ll enable you to ensure occupancy rates are as high as they can be and nightly rates are as high as possible - whilst minimising the time spent changing nightly rates manually.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><strong>Unified Inbox</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tired of being asked for the Wifi password? Don&rsquo;t waste your time logging in and out of various accounts - it&rsquo;s time consuming and just frustrating.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a PMS that enables you to easily manage </span><strong>all of your messages</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across all platforms - </span><strong>from one inbox</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Predefined responses can also be a great way to answer the common questions, with a click of a button. No more missed messages, the job is simply easier.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Detailed Property View</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox is great - but why not have a PMS which allows you to onboard with detailed internal photos then reference back within the database in seconds to instantly find a picture of anything in the property.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine your guest doesn&rsquo;t know how to turn the heating on - quite often than not the solution is not complicated. With a great PMS, you can now solve it over the phone within moments. That&rsquo;s right, no need for an expensive out-of-hours call out to the property at 10pm. Quick access to this data is a great way to save you time, money and stress.</span></p>
