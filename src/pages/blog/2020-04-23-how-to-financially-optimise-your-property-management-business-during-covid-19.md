  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimising your cost base is a crucial
  activity for any business, particularly during times of market
  uncertainty.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This post aims to
  help you uncover, reduce and eliminate all unnecessary costs in your property
  management business. By reducing your costs, whilst maintaining the same level
  of output, your profit will naturally strengthen, and therefore your business
  becomes more financially attractive and your long-term viability can
  increase.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Furlough staff</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, the UK g</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overnment is offering support packages to companies to help weather the storm. In order to prevent job losses due to the colossal impact COVID-19, the government have introduced a Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, whereby they will cover 80% of employees wages who would otherwise be made redundant (capped at &pound;2,500pm).</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to be eligible for this scheme, your employee/s must be put on furlough leave, and therefore cannot work. The leave must be a minimum of 3 weeks, in order to receive the government support. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scheme aims to help companies that have been affected by pandemic to retain their talent; allowing their team to return to work when it is right to do so.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are outside the UK, have a look at what types of schemes your government may be offering during this period.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many property management companies, your operational staff are essential to the everyday runnings of your business. It may be worth automating many of your operational processes. Property management software will help to cut down on your work load significantly and automate as much as possible. Lavanda&rsquo;s PMS offers time-saving features such as automated messaging, a unified inbox and task allocations.

  <p><strong>Eliminate all non-essential costs</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option for financial optimisation is to go through every cost line in your P&amp;L and see which non-essential costs can be removed, even just temporarily. If it can&rsquo;t be removed completely, consider, can it be reduced? You may wish to negotiate with your suppliers to see if they can offer some type of financial relief, even if just temporarily. They may already have something implemented to support customers impacted by COVID-19.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Preserve cash flow</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a time of high market uncertainty, the key thing you can do to protect your business is to preserve your cash flow. By retaining as much cash as possible, it ensures your core operating costs can be covered and gives you a greater control and projection of your runway.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use this opportunity to seek better payment terms with all of your outgoings:</span></p>

  <ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Renegotiate payment terms with all suppliers wherever possible.</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you rent an office, speak to your landlords to check if you&rsquo;re eligible for a </span>&ldquo;payment holiday."</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore if you are able defer payment of any taxes due.</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Explore if you are eligible for a business continuity loan. Many governments </span>are offering attractive loan facilities to support companies that are significantly impacted by COVID-19, enabling them to avoid making redundancies and contributing to raised unemployment levels.</li>

  </ul>
