  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photographs are the element of the listing
  that is most effective at generating bookings. So high quality, professional
  images of well-styled properties is absolutely essential. </span><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">Lavanda has created a guide on how to take
  professional photographs for your property management business.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Guidelines:</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All images need to be landscape (some platforms only allow for landscape images)&nbsp;</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 25 high resolution images (1920 x 1080 pixels), including at least one exterior shot and a few close up images of key property features</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No overly edited images in post production</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photos of every room, excluding the hallway, unless it is a key feature of the property.</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Styling:</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, styling refers to placing decorations and soft furnishings around the property to make it look more appealing and inviting to a potential guest. It is vital that the property is styled correctly in order to optimise the effectiveness of the listing photos.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><strong>Suggested Items to Purchase for Styling the Property:</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bunch of fresh flowers (ideally have a small vase with you)</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food: fresh pastries or bread with a complementary food (e.g. bread &amp; tomatoes, cake &amp; strawberries, etc.)</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A magazine</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A faux green pot plant for the bathroom</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cosy throw to place over the end of the bed</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key Things to Remember When Styling:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Kitchen and Dining Area</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that any wires from appliances are hidden</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are too many utensils or appliances on the kitchen side, consider hiding some items in the cupboards so that the room doesn&rsquo;t look cluttered.&nbsp;</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a food/dining display with the food items you have bought. Use the property&rsquo;s plates, cutlery and glasses.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put the fresh flowers out on the dining table, if the property has one.</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Living Area</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure cushions are plumped and neatly placed on the sofa</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put a magazine out on the coffee table</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Bedroom</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure the bed is made as neatly as possible and pillows and duvets are straight</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wardrobe doors are shut&nbsp;</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Towels folded neatly on the bed can be a nice touch if the stylist is confident in presenting neatly.</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Bathroom</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove the toilet brush and bin&nbsp;</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure the towels are straight and it all looks neat and tidy.</span></li>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that any toiletries are visible</span></li>

  </ul>
