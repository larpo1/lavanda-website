  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time ever, the HOST expo came
  around and was truly a resounding success - especially for the Lavanda
  team.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After working and live testing for years behind the scenes, Host 2019 marked the public launch of our Property Management System (PMS) which has been built to revolutionise property management and drive operational efficiency for property managers globally, like never before.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were there, you will have seen us on 31 October and 1 November at the Angel Business Design Centre in London proudly demonstrating our all-in-one PMS, impressing visitors from around the world - 59 countries to be precise.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For context - Host is the UK&rsquo;s largest exhibition exclusively for the short-term rental industry, to support rentalpreneurs and holiday rental entrepreneurs to get started with property management and to maximise revenue from their properties.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lavanda was exhibiting amongst industry names including Airbnb, HomeAway &amp; Guardhog.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><strong>Lavanda Talks Trust</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two days were filled with over </span><strong>100 inspiring talks</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and thought-provoking workshops from industry experts and professionals with topics varying from; ensuring that your property management is on the right side of legislation, to selecting the most suitable furnishings and using aesthetics favourably to optimise occupancy and the revenues of a short term rental.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lavanda&rsquo;s CEO - Fred Lerche-Lerchenborg, spoke on Friday on a panel hosted by GUARDHOG about the importance of trust in the short-term rental space - explaining how Lavanda is working tirelessly to change the perceptions in the real estate industry.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fred explained how the Lavanda Home Guarantee, a comprehensive and global insurance policy has been implemented for all bookings through the Lavanda platform to ensure that both the property and its contents are protected every time - providing landlords with increased trust and peace of mind that was previously a massive issue industry issue.</span></p>

  <p><strong>A Huge Thank You</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to all those that visited our stand at HOST. Lavanda has truly developed a groundbreaking and intuitive Property Management System, which led to fantastic feedback during the event - as we continually work to make property management easier.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lavanda team are very excited to meet you at the next event - so please ensure that you stay tuned on our blog and LinkedIn profile for announcements about events that we will be attending in the future. We wouldn&rsquo;t want you to miss out next time, if you did with Host 2019!&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><strong>Reinforcing Our Position Within the BTR Sector.&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lavanda was exhibiting at the UKAA Conference for built-to-rent developers (BTR) on 31 October. Our CEO, Frederik Lerche-Lerchenborg, attended along with colleagues Sam Symons - Built-to-Rent and Multifamily associate and Emily Upshall - our Customer Success Manager. We had the pleasure of meeting new BTR developers looking to increase their NOI in addition to building upon relationships with our existing partners.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working tirelessly to change the perception and build up trust of the short-term rental industry on developers. We strongly believe that it can bring huge benefits for the industry and is a fast-growing opportunity.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our lease up product can be a powerful tool to maximise yields, with instantaneous revenue when a new development is built. We can eliminate voids, by monetising periods during tenancies with fully vetted short term guests.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our ethos is to conduct sustainably short term rentals - on the right side of legislation to ensure that the brand reputation of our clients are maintained.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your portfolio has properties that could be montised immediately by deploying short-term lets, we are the go-to partner for many asset owners given our starling reputation and industry knowledge.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to all that attended the event, if you wish to find out more about how we can maximise yields on your assets - book a discovery call.</span></p>
